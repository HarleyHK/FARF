# FARF

Feature-augmented Random Forest

This is the project code (Matlab) for the paper: "Image Super-resolution via Feature-augmented Random Forest"

The code of FARF also contains the implementation of the image super-resolution part in the paper: "Joint Maximum Purity Forest with Application to Image Super-Resolution"

We will release the code when the paper "Image Super-resolution via Feature-augmented Random Forest" is accepted.
